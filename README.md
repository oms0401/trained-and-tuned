# Trained and tuned Project repository üöÄ

This README provides step-by-step instructions to run two Python scripts, `llm.py` and `rag.py`, which leverage the Groq API for building intelligent chatbots.

## Prerequisites üõ†Ô∏è

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

* **Python 3.8 or higher:** You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
* **pip:** Python package installer, usually included with Python installations.

Additionally, this project uses a `requirements.txt` file to manage dependencies. It's highly recommended to create a virtual environment to isolate the project dependencies.

### 1. Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended) üì¶

1.  Open your terminal or command prompt.
2.  Navigate to the directory where you have saved the project files.
3.  Create a virtual environment using `venv` (or `conda` if you prefer):

    ```bash
    # Using venv
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS and Linux
    venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows

    # Using conda (if you have Anaconda installed)
    conda create -n groq_chat python=3.9  # Or your preferred Python version
    conda activate groq_chat
    ```

### 2. Install Dependencies ‚öôÔ∏è

1.  Make sure your virtual environment is activated.
2.  Navigate to the directory containing the `requirements.txt` file.
3.  Install all the necessary libraries using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    This command will install the following packages (and their dependencies):

    * `streamlit`
    * `langchain`
    * `langchain-groq`
    * `python-dotenv`
    * `transformers`
    * `pypdf`
    * `torch`
    * `nest-asyncio`

### 3. Obtain a Groq API Key üîë

1.  Go to the [Groq Cloud website](https://console.groq.com/) and sign up for an account.
2.  Once logged in, navigate to the API Keys section (usually under your profile or settings).
3.  Create a new API key. **Keep this key secure and do not share it.**

### 4. Create an Environment File (`.env`) üìÇ

1.  In the same directory where you have saved the `llm.py` and `rag.py` scripts, create a new file named `.env`.
2.  Open the `.env` file and add your Groq API key as follows:

    ```
    GROQ_API_KEY="YOUR_GROQ_API_KEY"
    ```

    Replace `"YOUR_GROQ_API_KEY"` with the actual API key you obtained from the Groq Cloud website.

### 5. Prepare the PDF Document (for `rag.py`) üìÑ

1.  For the `rag.py` script, you need a PDF document to perform Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
2.  Save the PDF document named `OpenAI AI Agents.pdf` in the same directory as your Python scripts.

## Running the Scripts with Streamlit üèÉ

You can run each script individually using Streamlit commands in your terminal. **Ensure your virtual environment is still activated.**

### Running `llm.py` (Simple Chatbot) üí¨

1.  Open your terminal or command prompt.
2.  Navigate to the directory where you saved `llm.py`.
3.  Run the following command:

    ```bash
    streamlit run llm.py
    ```

4.  Streamlit will automatically open a new tab in your web browser displaying the "Ask Chatbot!" application.
5.  You can now type your prompts in the chat input and interact with the Groq-powered language model.

### Running `rag.py` (RAG-Based Chatbot) üìö

1.  Open your terminal or command prompt (you can use the same one or open a new one).
2.  Navigate to the directory where you saved `rag.py` and the `OpenAI AI Agents.pdf` file.
3.  Run the following command:

    ```bash
    streamlit run rag.py
    ```

4.  Streamlit will automatically open a new tab in your web browser displaying the "Ask RAG-Chatbot!" application.
5.  You can now type your prompts related to the content of the `OpenAI AI Agents.pdf` document. The chatbot will retrieve relevant information from the PDF and use it to generate its responses.

## Interacting with the Chatbots üó£Ô∏è

Once the Streamlit applications are running in your browser:

* **Type your question or prompt** in the text input field at the bottom of the page.
* **Press Enter** or click the send button.
* The chatbot's response will appear in the chat window along with your message history.

Enjoy interacting with your Groq-powered chatbots!

## AI Engineering Roadmap üó∫Ô∏è

Here's a roadmap to guide you on your journey to becoming an AI Engineer:

**Resources for the AI engineering guide**

**Stage 1) - Python Fundamentals üêç**

* **Python Basics**
    * Playlist link - [Python Tutorial](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkQC5wF3Zy4Ug2MCKV_jeyX8_Fyb4O2Ot&feature=shared)
